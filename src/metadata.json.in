    "description": "Yet Another Window List = app icons (taskbar) on top panel + window thumbnails + \"window peeking\" (preview of windows by scrolling over their thumbnails) + app-specific remote menus + Quicklists + windows attention + scrolling over panel to change workspace + \"smart scroll\" to search app's windows on other workspaces + lots of settings + much more. Latest version 10 (check your version on Welcome page in Preferences): https://extensions.gnome.org/review/download/3129.shell-extension.zip.\n\nIf you keep up with the latest GitHub version, just run install-extension to update.\n\nThe extension works out-of-the-box but provides many settings to adjust its look/behavior: rearrange task bar to give icons more space, change sizes, colors, animation, customize mouse actions etc. No settings require Gnome-Shell restart: adjust it all in real time. You can also export/import settings to back up, sync or share.\n\nDefault mouse actions include (see/adjust all mouse actions in preferences):\n1) Window Thumbnails:\n- Scroll up/down: Window Peeking ON/OFF + change thumbnails opacity\n- Left click: focus window\n- Middle click: maximize/restore window\n- Right click (or Shift+left click): minimize window\n2) App Icons:\n- Scroll: change workspace (if thumbnails are shown -- stick to app)\n- Left click: switch to app / cycle through its windows\n- Shift+left click (double click): minimize top (all) app window(s)\n- Right click: show app menu\n\nThe first time you install the extension it welcomes you with preference dialog. Extension is translation-ready. Please report problems and suggestions here or on GitHub.\n\n--- What's new (check your version on Welcome page in Preferences) ---\n--- UR = under review: use link above to download the latest version ---\nv11 (UR): Search app's windows on other workspaces: scroll over app's icon while its thumbnails are shown; option to show thumbnails of all or 'interesting' windows only\nv10 (UR): First MILESTONE: performance optimizations + scrolling over panel to change workspace + option to adjust attention blinking rate + updated install-extension script for those keeping up-to-date by pulling git version\nv9: Support windows demanding attention; show (optionally) icons of applications from all workspaces; turn (optionally) thumbnails off; advanced right-click menus",
