### Description
 
YAWL is a Gnome-Shell extension that is similar to Window 7 taskbar. It aims to provide maximum convenience and consistency when manipulating windows in Gnome-Shell.

**Main features include**: task bar with thumbnails, "window peeking" to preview window by hovering its thumbnail, app-specific menus, Quicklists, window attention indicators, scrolling over panel to change workspace, "smart scroll" to search app's windows on other workspaces and others.

The extension works out of the box but provides numerous settings to adjust its look and behavior to your liking.
