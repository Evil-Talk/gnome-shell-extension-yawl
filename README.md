        cd /path/to/where/you/want/subdir/with/yawl
        git clone https://github.com/dbfin/gnome-shell-extension-yawl
        cd gnome-shell-extension-yawl

And if you install extension from the GitHub repository, then it might be more convenient to checkout the corresponding branch into a separate directory:

``` bash
cd /path/to/where/you/want/subdir/with/branch
git clone https://github.com/dbfin/gnome-shell-extension-yawl branch
cd branch
git checkout branch
./install-extension branch
```
