    "description": "Activities button is an essential part of GNOME Shell for those of us on touch screens. However, it is almost useless for the rest. This extension presents an Alternative Activities button that provides some functionality useful for everyone: the current workspace number, scrolling over to switch workspace, left click to open Overview, and right click to open up a menu containing the list of all workspaces with icons of running apps plus Extension Manager (the list of all installed extensions with additional options). Latest version @EXTENSIONVERSION@ (check your version on Welcome page in Preferences).\n\nExtension options:\n- Quick access to extension's preferences\n- Soft restart of the extension (disable + enable)\n- Hard restart of the extension (reload extension's code)\n- Favorite extensions (shows at the top of the list)\n\n--- What's new (UR = under review, use link above to install manually) ---\nv1 (UR): First version. Your feedback is appreciated.\n\nIf you keep up with the latest GitHub version, checkout branch 'aa' and run `install-extension aa` to update after pull. You need some dev-libraries installed. Please consult README.md for further details.\n\nExtension is translation-ready. There is a Wiki page on GitHub with instructions. Please report problems and suggestions here or on GitHub.",
